This program was made for fast evaluation of flight batteries under real load.

This requires an entire flight with a fully charged battery. The assessment is (and can be) only very superficial and is dependent on or influenced by many factors. Nevertheless, it can be seen intuitively, at least on the diagram, how the discharge behavior of the battery is. The advantage over pure voltage measurement is that you can see the voltage curve under load. If the voltage drops sharply under load, this indicates a high internal resistance of the battery. This happens gradually with aging or relatively quickly with defects.
In any case, it is questionable to fly batteries that can no longer be fully trusted. Therefore I consider a constant observation of the batteries necessary (post-flight-check).
This tool should simplify that.
